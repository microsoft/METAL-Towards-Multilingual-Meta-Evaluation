    "scoring": "0: bad content -- If the text sounds repetitive (or is non-factual/inconsistent or it's not in the given language, or seems to have been web-scrapped); 1: OK content, but some flaws found -- If it's ok (grammatical, lexically, vocab is good) but kind of goes around in circles; 2: good or above content."
